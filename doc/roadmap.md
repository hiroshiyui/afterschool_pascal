# Roadmap

What is open: the goal, what blocks it, the questions no record has answered,
and what is wrong or absent today.

**How the compiler got here is [`doc/history.md`](history.md)** — the
bootstrap, both standards, the conformance sweeps, the dialect increment by
increment, and since this revision **every question this file has closed**,
with what closing it found. That document is settled and this one is not,
which is why they are two: an entry here is something someone still has to
decide about, and the day it is decided it moves there.

## The goal (ADR-0109)

**A Pascal you can get daily work done in**: a dialect and a standard core
library for networking, internationalisation, concurrent execution, and memory
safety as a property of the language rather than a convention.

Two goals came before this one — bootstrapping, then conformance — and both are
**finished**: the compiler compiles itself, and both standards are complete to
the last clause. The conformance modes are not going away. The dialect is a
third mode beside `--std=iso7185` and `--std=extended`, and it changes
neither: what they *accept* moves only for a reason inside their own standard,
and what they *say* may mention the dialect where a program was compiled under
the wrong mode (ADR-0154).

**Four decisions the goal forces**, each to get its own record when it is made:

| Decision | Where it stands |
| --- | --- |
| **The memory-safety model** | Half answered, and the answered half took two records rather than one. *Lifetime* — an owned value is released when the variable holding it dies and cannot be copied out of it — was already here, being what a file variable has been since 1982 (ADR-0151). But that sentence quantifies over a *variable*, and a variable created by `new` is held by nothing: it exists in no activation, so nothing released what a heap record owned unless the program said `dispose`, and under a 64-descriptor limit a loop allocating one per iteration ran out at the 62nd. `owned ^T` gives such a variable an owner and closes it (ADR-0181, AP 6.4.14). The *aliasing* half — may a second name hold one owned value, and if so how: ARC, or borrowing — is undecidable on the evidence in hand, and becomes decidable at the first construct that demands two live names. Concurrency is that construct, and an owned pointer is deliberately not: it cannot be copied at all. |
| **The text model** | **Decided and specified; nothing is built** (ADR-0189, AP 6.4.15, AP 5.6). The choice this row offered for eleven records — *a wider character type or a text type* — turned out not to exist: widening `char` stops `set of char` compiling under ADR-0028's 256-value cap, which breaks ADR-0117's containment, so it is the second or nothing. The model is `utf8(n)`, a **value with a capacity in bytes** holding well-formed UTF-8 in normal form C, whose elements are **grapheme clusters** and whose element type is itself a text. Normalising where a value is constructed rather than where two are compared is the load-bearing choice: it makes `=` byte equality *and* canonical equivalence at once, so `'é'` typed either way is one value and a text can be a `pasmap` key. There is no integer index, for Swift's reason. **Three of four increments are landed** (ADR-0190 – ADR-0192): the tables and the runtime primitives, judged by Unicode's own conformance files — 20 034 normalisation cases and 766 segmentation cases, and a sweep of every code point the first does not list. the tables and the runtime primitives; and then the **type** — `utf8(n)` is a type `--std=afterschool` has, with assignment, comparison, `length` in elements, `capacity` in bytes and `write`. A decomposed literal and a composed one are one value, and `=` is byte equality and canonical equivalence at once; and then **joining and walking** — `+` renormalises across the join, `for g in t` yields elements, and rejoining them gives back the original, which is what says a grapheme boundary is also a boundary of normal form. **AP 6.4.15 is implemented in full** and AP 5.6's list of clauses ahead of the processor is empty. What is left is `PasUnicode`: the scalar view, case mapping and folding, and the fallible conversion a program needs to handle ill-formed input without stopping. |
| **The memory model** | Unstarted, and it cannot be designed before the safety model: shared mutable state is where the two meet. |
| **How far the C++ reference front end follows** (ADR-0108) | Frozen at the conformance surface in practice — `difftest` skips a dialect source — and that is the obvious answer, not the decided one. |

What is already in hand and was not built for this: modules and separate
compilation (ADR-0053, ADR-0079) mean a library needs no new language
mechanism, and `runtime/pasrt.c` is where the outside world already enters.

---

## What blocks the library

**Nothing is left on this list.** It has been emptied, and the last row went
the way the two before it did — a decision that looked like it needed the
memory-safety model turned out to need it for only part of its surface.

~~A foreign struct the callee owns~~ is **done** (ADR-0187, AP 6.7.7.8): an
`external` function may answer an optional of a record, a null address is the
absent value, and any other address yields a **copy** made where the call
occurs. That is the whole of it, and choosing a copy is what kept the model out
of it — nothing holds the address, so there is no lifetime to reason about.
`readdir`, `gmtime` and `localtime` are declarable. What is still not
declarable is a member that is *itself* a pointer, so a chained list of structs
— `getaddrinfo` — waits, and it waits on the model rather than on a clause.

**And a rule this page had not noticed cuts across all of it** (ADR-0188).
ADR-0187 is a *program*-level feature: a program knows what it was built for
and can have its field list checked by `foreign-layout`, and a **library**
cannot, ADR-0185's fifth decision being categorical. `struct dirent` differs on
glibc and macOS and POSIX does not fix its member order; `struct tm` is
standardised by ISO C and *that clause* does not fix its member order either.
So the set of structs `lib/` may declare is close to empty, and a module
wanting one asks the runtime — which is how `PasDir` was built, and why the row
below closed without using the record that unblocked it.

~~The struct with a layout~~ is **done** (ADR-0184, AP 6.7.7.6.2), and the
sentence that stood here — *crossing one needs the compiler and C to agree
about offsets, which nothing here does for a foreign type* — was wrong in the
direction this page has now been wrong in four times. Nothing had to be made
to agree: `RecordLayout` already *is* C's struct rule, so a record of
`struct stat`'s fields was 144 bytes at C's own offsets before anything was
written. The gap was permission, not arithmetic, and a record now crosses as a
`var` parameter. `struct sockaddr`, `struct stat` and `struct timespec` are
declarable; what a program still writes for itself is the field list, and
nothing checks it against the header.

Everything else a survey of daily needs found is closed. The library is
eighteen modules — eight conforming, ten dialect — and that survey
(2026-08-23, against the thirteen that then existed) named six gaps. Three
needed no language change and closed the same day: `PasFile` (after ADR-0172),
`PasProcess`, `PasStrVec`. Of the three that needed one, the command line as a
list turned out to be a feature rather than a module (ADR-0173), the opaque
handle is ADR-0174, and the struct is ADR-0184 — so all six are closed, and
what remains above is the narrower half none of them named.

Why those last three were one item underneath: what cannot cross is **a pointer
to storage the callee owns whose contents are not characters**. Every foreign
type that crosses today is a scalar, a string copied at the call, or a slice the
caller owns (AP §6.7.7). ~~The opaque half~~ is **done** — `handle external
'closedir'` is a file variable for a foreign address, released where a file
closes (ADR-0174, AP 6.4.12) — and what it deliberately does not touch is
aliasing: a handle cannot be copied at all, so no two names reach one value.
~~The half whose contents have a shape~~ is **done too**, in both directions:
a record crosses as a `var` parameter, so `stat` fills a buffer this program
declared (ADR-0184), and comes back as an optional whose value is copied at
the call, so `readdir` answers one this program then owns (ADR-0187). ~~The
piece that needed the memory model~~ — storage the callee owns **and** whose
shape the program must read — turned out not to need it either, because the
copy retires the address at the end of the statement. What genuinely waits on
the model is narrower than any row here ever said: a struct **member** that is
a pointer, which is a second name for storage and cannot be copied away.

**What that leaves open, by name:**

| A daily program wants | Why it waits |
| --- | --- |
| ~~a directory listing~~ | **done** — `PasDir` (ADR-0188), and it went a way the row above did not predict. ADR-0187 makes `readdir` declarable by a *program*; a **library** may not declare `struct dirent` at all, ADR-0185's fifth decision holding and POSIX not even fixing the member order. So `opendir` and `closedir` are bound directly, the `DIR *` is a handle, and the runtime supplies the one member access. `PasProcess.CaptureLines('ls -1 dir', names)` is superseded |
| ~~a socket~~ | **unblocked** (ADR-0184): `sockaddr` is a caller-owned struct and crosses as a `var` parameter. What is left is a module and a decision about what a portable `sockaddr` declaration looks like, `struct stat` having shown that a hand-written field list is one platform's layout — not a language gap |
| ~~creating a file through `PasIO`~~ | **done**, beside it rather than in it: `PasStream` opens a file through `fopen`, whose mode is a string and needs no header number, and owns the stream as a handle (ADR-0174). `PasIO` stays descriptor-only |

**What building on the handle found.** Two modules were written over
AP 6.4.12 the day it landed, and each met one edge of the clause:

- **There is no `h := nil`.** 6.4.12.2 gives a handle exactly one assignment,
  from an external function of its type, so a program cannot close a stream
  before its block ends except by opening another. `PasStream.Close` does it
  with `fopen` of the empty path — an assignment whose answer is always null,
  costing a refused system call and a stale `errno`. A second assignment form
  is one Sema arm and one `pas_handle_set` with a null value; it waits for a
  second module to want it.
- **A closer's result is discarded**, 6.4.12.1 says, and `pclose`'s result is
  the child's wait status. `PasProcess.Capture` gets the exit code through
  the stream instead — the shell prints `$?` after the output, behind a marker
  — which misreads a program that writes a control character 1 at the start
  of a line. The language change would be a handle whose closer's result is
  kept somewhere a program can read it, and nothing has said where.

**The lesson from the FFI increments**, worth keeping for whatever replaces the
rows above: a decision that looks like it needs a model may need it for only
part of its surface, and the part that does not is usually worth taking first.
Four estimates in a row were wrong in that useful direction — ADR-0122 and
ADR-0123, then ADR-0184, whose item this page had described as needing the
compiler and C to agree about offsets when they already did, then ADR-0187,
whose item this page had called the place *where the memory-safety model
actually bites*. It did not bite there. It bites one level further in, at a
struct member that is a pointer, and the reason is worth stating in general:
**an ownership question is only a question while something holds the address.**
Each of the four was answered by arranging for nothing to.

---

## Where the ideas come from

Rust, Swift and Zig are the reference points, and they do not all fit equally:
Pascal's grain is value semantics, explicitness and a small orthogonal core,
which is close to Zig and Swift and further from Rust. Each borrowing is tied to
the open decision it would settle.

| Idea | From | Settles | Where it stands |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Slices — a pointer and a length | Zig, Rust | bounds safety | **Done** (ADR-0125, ADR-0129) |
| Optionals, and no bare null | Swift, Rust | pointer safety | **Done** (ADR-0123); the check is localised to `^`, not eliminated |
| Scope-based release | ISO 7185, Rust's `Drop` | lifetime | **Done, and it was already here** (ADR-0151) — for a *declared* variable. A created one had no owner until ADR-0181 |
| ~~An owning pointer~~ | Rust's `Box` | lifetime, for the heap | **Done** (ADR-0181, AP 6.4.14): `owned ^T` disposes what it identifies when its own variable dies, and cannot be copied. Reached from the file variable rather than from Rust, and it decides nothing about aliasing because it admits no second name |
| ~~A move~~ | Rust's `mem::take` | what an affine type needs to be usable | **Done** (ADR-0182, AP 6.4.14.6): `take(v)` empties a variable and yields what it held, in the one position an owned value may be assigned. Found by writing the client: without it push-front and pop-front are each two copies, so an owned chain had no constant-time operation at all |
| Explicit allocator passing | Zig | part of memory safety | **Tried; does not survive contact** (ADR-0116) |
| ~~Error unions / `Result`~~ | Zig, Rust | error handling | **Done** (ADR-0176, AP 6.4.13): `T ! E` is the result record ADR-0120's convention described, written by the compiler with the field names fixed |
| ~~An early exit~~ | Turbo Pascal, Delphi, FPC | what propagation stands on | **Done** (ADR-0177, AP 6.7.5.9): `exit` terminates one activation, `exit(e)` assigns the result first. The one borrowing here whose source is another *Pascal* rather than another language |
| ~~Propagation~~ | Zig's `try`, Rust's `?` | the rest of error handling | **Done** (ADR-0178, AP 6.8.9): `try(x)` yields the value or leaves the enclosing function with the cause. Spelled as a required function because no position would serve — see below |
| ~~`defer`~~ | Zig, Swift | resource safety | **Done** (ADR-0175, AP 6.9.3.11): `defer S` arms a statement, executed when the statement-sequence it stands in is completed or when the activation terminates. Zig's unit rather than Go's, because a per-activation defer runs a loop's `dispose(p)` once with the last `p` |
| Unicode-correct `String` | Swift | the text model | **Decided, and the language half is built** (ADR-0189 – ADR-0192). The grapheme as the unit and the refusal of an integer index are Swift's and are taken whole. Its *storage* is not: Swift's `String` is a reference-counted heap buffer, which is the construct ADR-0151 says forces the aliasing decision, so this is a value with a declared capacity instead — and that in turn is what makes normalise-on-construction affordable, which Swift cannot do and which buys a bytewise `=` |
| ARC | Swift | aliasing | **Undecidable on the evidence in hand** (ADR-0151) |
| Ownership and borrowing | Rust | aliasing | **The same, and the worst fit besides** — and the most expensive thing to mirror in `src/` |
| Traits / protocols | Rust, Swift | abstraction | **Later.** Schemata already give parametric types (ADR-0039) |
| `comptime` | Zig | metaprogramming | **Later.** Constant-expressions everywhere (ADR-0054) is as far as anything needs |
| Actors / `Send`+`Sync` | Swift, Rust | concurrency | **Blocked**, and it is what *unblocks* the two aliasing rows: concurrency is the construct that certainly demands two live names for one value |

Two conclusions worth stating:

- **The cheap items are not the small ones.** `defer` and error unions between
  them cover most of what "daily practical development" means, and neither
  required settling the memory-safety fork. Both are done (ADR-0175,
  ADR-0176), and the second was cheaper than this table predicted: it was
  expected to be "the larger of the two — a type constructor over a type", and
  it turned out to need no new type at all. `T ! E` denotes an ordinary record
  with a flag on it, so the copy, the layout and ADR-0118's trap came free and
  **CodeGen was not touched**. The lesson is ADR-0122 and ADR-0123's, a third
  time: an estimate that assumes a feature needs its own machinery is worth
  probing before it is believed.

- **Error handling is finished**, and it took three records rather than one.
  `T ! E` says what a failure is (ADR-0176), `exit` is how a block is left
  (ADR-0177), and `try(x)` connects them (ADR-0178). The two questions this
  entry said `try` still had to answer both got answers worth keeping. *What
  must the enclosing result type be?* — nothing in particular: the cause has
  only to be assignable to it, which the assignment already decides, so a
  function answering the error type takes the cause directly and the question
  dissolves. *Is there a spelling a conforming program could not have
  written?* — **no**, and that is the finding. ADR-0176 had sketched `try X`
  by the rule that works for a statement; a factor may be a variable-access,
  so `try (x)`, `try [x]`, `try + x`, `try - x`, `try.f` and `try^` all mean
  something to a program that declares `try`. It is a required identifier
  instead, which is `exit`'s answer and now the commoner of the dialect's two
  spelling shapes.

- **`exit` cost less than the table above expected, and for the third time the
  reason was the same.** It is a branch to the epilogue every block already
  had, so the armed statements, the files and the result all came free — the
  same shape as ADR-0176's "no new type" and ADR-0123's before it. What was
  *not* free was a gate: `exit(e)` can only stand in a function-block, and
  `predicate-callers`'s probe program declared its subject as a procedure, so
  the position had to be given a function to live in. A gate that would have
  passed for the wrong reason is worth more attention than the feature was.
- **ARC and borrowing are not equally costly here**, and the difference is not
  only effort: borrowing would make ADR-0108's C++ mirror prohibitively
  expensive and likely force the decision to freeze it. ADR-0151 declines to
  decide on that — cost is a reason to prefer one, not evidence about which the
  language needs.

One option **closes** as the language diverges: a third-party differential
(FPC under `-Miso`, or p5) can only ever check the ISO 7185 core, because
nobody else implements this dialect. Worth spending while it is still worth
anything — it is the first item under the next heading.

---

## The open questions

Seven structural questions about the dialect and five items of *what is next*
used to stand here. Nine of the twelve are answered — the table at the end
says where — and what each found on its first run is in
[`doc/history.md`](history.md#what-the-roadmap-answered). Three remain.

### 1. The dialect has no external authority, and every gate here is anchored in one

A standing **risk** rather than a task, and the one entry no record can close.

| | ISO 7185 | Extended Pascal | the dialect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| third-party corpus | BSI, 812 programs | — | **—** |
| second implementation (`difftest`) | yes | yes | the refusal surface only (ADR-0160) |
| clause-cited scenarios | yes | yes | yes (ADR-0135) |
| independent reading | ADR-0101, ADR-0107 | ADR-0101, ADR-0107 | [the spec](afterschool-pascal-spec.md), audited once (ADR-0144) |
| goldens, irtest, `verify/` | yes | yes | yes |

Every oracle in this repository bottoms out in *the standard says X*, and no
oracle here can contradict a **reading** — which is how ADR-0072's set-packing
deviation survived in four documents and a purpose-written test. For the two
conformance modes the remedy is independent readers holding the standards text
(`.claude/skills/langspec-audit/`). For the dialect there is no text but the
one this project wrote, so an audit can check every claim the specification
makes *about* the standards — nine were wrong the first time — and cannot check
a requirement the dialect invents, where a reader can only ask whether the
processor agrees with the document.

What is still empty is the first row, and nothing can fill it: there is no
third-party corpus for a language this project invented, and the BSI suite is
unavailable for a second reason besides — the dialect contains Extended Pascal,
not ISO 7185. The second row is partial: everything the dialect **accepts** is
compared by no second implementation. A high citation fraction means the
specification is young and was written against a compiler someone could probe,
not that the dialect is as well checked as the conformance modes.

Two authorities *are* available and should be used wherever they reach: **POSIX
and the C ABI** for anything FFI-facing (the slice's shape was the far side's
choice, ADR-0129), and the standards themselves wherever they answer the same
question differently — ISO 7185 §6.6.3.7's conformant array is the standard's
own answer to the slice's question, found only after the slice had landed
(ADR-0152). A new dialect feature should look for its authority before its
spelling.

**A third is the other Pascals**, and it is worth naming because this entry
reads as though there were none. Turbo Pascal, Delphi and Free Pascal are
*dialects* — none of them implements either standard completely, and each
answered questions these standards do not: an early `Exit`, `Break` and
`Continue`, `try..finally`, a string type that grows. Where one of them has
already answered a question this dialect is asking, that answer is a reference
point: not because it is authoritative — it is not, and two of them disagree
with each other — but because a Pascal programmer arriving here already knows
it, and gratuitous novelty is a cost paid by every future reader.

**And the absence of an oracle is a fact about how a claim is checked, never a
reason not to make one.** This entry is a risk register, not a brake. Where no
authority answers, the dialect answers for itself — reasonably, in the
standards' own idiom, written down in the specification and pinned by a case
that fails without it. That is what every one of ADR-0117 onward did, and the
discipline that matters is internal: a named failing test, a mutation that
kills it, a clause that says what was meant. What this entry warns about is
narrower than it looks — that a *misreading of the two standards* is invisible
here — and it has nothing to say about a facility the dialect invents outright,
where there is no reading to get wrong.

### 2. A third-party differential

FPC under `-Miso`, or p5, over the ISO 7185 half of `tests/`. Not a second
implementation to maintain: a second *answer*, on programs that already exist.
**The only candidate that would contradict a misreading** — the BSI suite is a
fixed corpus from 1982, and `difftest` compares this project against itself,
both front ends being written by one author from one reading. Closes as the
language diverges, so it is worth more now than later.

### 3. Mutation testing, committed to the tree

It has found something every time it has been run here — the occasions are
listed in history under *Stage 1*, and ADR-0065's two mutants changed the
compiler rather than the tests — and it exists only as prose in those records
and as a step in `doc/sop.md`. Two things it needs, both learned the expensive
way: a wall-clock and output-size limit per mutant, because a looping mutant
fills the disk before anything notices; and a restore that does **not**
preserve mtime, or the mutated binary stays in the build tree and the next
control run reads as a broken feature.

---

## Cross-platform support

The repository is developed on x86-64 Linux and **built and tested on aarch64
on every push**, natively, from a seed whose header lines still say x86-64.
That port was measured rather than estimated (2026-08-22), and the lock turned
out to be three things for an LP64 little-endian target — two lines of emitted
text, one size constant, and a seed for the new host — of which the first two
are done (ADR-0155, ADR-0156, ADR-0157, ADR-0159). The measurements are in
[`doc/history.md`](history.md#cross-platform-support-measured); what follows is
what they leave.

**Where every target stands on layout**, from `target-layout`'s own comparison
run over 25 targets, all 4538 offsets each:

| target | offsets differing | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| aarch64, riscv64, powerpc64le, loongarch64, mips64el | 0 | LP64 little-endian |
| powerpc64, mips64, aarch64_be, sparcv9 | 0 | LP64 big-endian — endianness decides what a byte means, not where a field sits |
| x86_64 and arm64 apple-darwin; x86_64 and aarch64 windows | 0 | Mach-O and COFF agree |
| s390x | **13** | aligns `i256` to 8 where every other target says 16 — ADR-0028's shape exactly |
| i686, arm, riscv32, mipsel, powerpc, x32, … | 3858–3904 | **every 32-bit target** |

### What is left

**32-bit, which is the real work.** `LlSize` says a pointer is 8 by
construction; `tyProc` and `tySlice` are two pointers; `tyFile`'s alignment is
8. All of those become target-dependent, which means `LlAlign` and `LlSize`
stop being constants and start asking the target — and ADR-0129's `i64` count
at the foreign boundary is a second, independent question with a decision in it
rather than a lowering. Nothing here is blocked on measurement any more.

**The rest is small and specific.** s390x's `tySet` alignment (13 offsets, and
`target-layout` fails loudly if it is ever admitted). Windows: `fmemopen` and
`open_memstream` do not exist in the CRT, so `readstr` and `writestr` need two
hand-written `FILE*`-over-memory functions, `access` is `_access`, and MSVC
lacks the `_Complex` §6.7.6.2's functions are written in. **macOS needs none
of it** — the runtime's five non-ISO names are all there — and has never been
tried, which makes it the cheapest unknown in the chapter.

### What is not claimed

**aarch64 works; it is not supported.** No release ships an aarch64 binary,
`seed/pascalc.ll` is generated for x86-64, and `seed/README.md`'s target lock
stands. CI establishes that the port *works* — the seed retargets textually,
the layout rules hold for a second machine, the runtime's constants clear it —
not that an artefact is maintained for it.

**Not every oracle follows.** `llc-second-backend` skips on the arm64 job, and
the SMT proofs are about the lowering *model*, the same file on either machine.
A miscompilation only an aarch64 backend produces has nothing looking for it
(`doc/sop.md` §7).

**The layout gate sees frames and nothing else.** A global's alignment, a string
constant's, and the ABI arguments travel by are outside it.

---

## Known limitations

Things that are wrong or absent today, listed so they are not rediscovered as
surprises. Each is a decision with a record or a piece of work with none yet;
the two kinds are marked.

### Under ISO 7185

- **Nesting deeper than 1000 levels is rejected** (ADR-0020, ADR-0110). A
  limit on the *tree*, protecting four recursive walkers with an order of
  magnitude of headroom against the measured crash point. Legal
  machine-generated programs with chains beyond 1000 terms are refused. *A
  decision.*

- **A variable created by `new(p, c1, …, cn)` may still be assigned or
  passed.** §6.6.5.3 forbids it; detecting it needs the pointer's *value* to
  carry which form created it, and nothing tracks that (ADR-0027). *A decision,
  permissive where the standard is restrictive.*

- **Use-after-dispose through a second pointer is undetected.** `dispose(p)`
  sets `p` to nil, which turns the common form into the nil trap, and that is
  all it does (ADR-0019). *The memory-safety model's aliasing half, above.* The
  dialect's `owned ^T` sidesteps rather than closes this: storage declared that
  way can have no second pointer, so there is nothing to dangle — but §6.4.4's
  ordinary pointer is untouched, and ADR-0181 withdraws nothing.

- **A text file's last line need not end in a terminator.** §6.4.3.5 says it
  does, so one is supplied when the file is read; reading at end-of-*file*
  is D.97's error and stops the program. *A decision (ADR-0021).*

- **Characters are bytes, and the locale is never consulted.** `char` is
  0..255, UTF-8 passes through, a multi-byte character is several `char`
  values. This one is not going to change: ADR-0189 records that `char`
  *cannot* widen without breaking containment, and puts the answer in a type
  beside the string rather than underneath it — `utf8(n)`, which
  `--std=afterschool` now has (ADR-0191). *The text model, above.*

- **A set's base type must have its values in 0..255**, every set being one
  256-bit word. §6.4.3.4 leaves the size to the implementation, so this is a
  permitted limit rather than a deviation — but `set of integer` is a legal
  program this compiler refuses (ADR-0028). *A decision.*

- **An identifier may contain an underscore**, where §6.1.3 does not allow
  one. It is how a name that would collide with a word-symbol is spelled, and
  how a test program takes the name of its file (ADR-0072). *A decision, and
  one of the two extensions `doc/implementation-defined.md` §5 lists.*

### Under ISO/IEC 10206:1991

**Bindability is a property of the type-denoter, and two of its three shapes
are still read elsewhere.** ADR-0167's reader found five programs refused by
this; a field or array element of a bindable type can be bound now, and two
pieces remain. *Work with no record yet, and a record is owed before either.*

- **A dereference is answered `bindable` without asking**, so `bind(p^, b)`
  compiles for `p: ^text` as well as for `p: ^bindable text`. A pointer's
  domain reaches Sema through `ResolvePointer`'s deferred paths, where the
  denoter is no longer in hand. `doc/implementation-defined.md` §6.1 carries
  it as a program accepted that the standard requires to be rejected. *A fix.*

- **A `var` parameter of file-type takes its bindability from the actual, at
  run time.** §6.7.3.3 NOTE 1: "determined **dynamically** by the
  actual-parameter", and §6.7.5.6 and §6.7.6.8 make the file case a
  *dynamic-violation*. §6.7.6.8's own worked example, `procedure bindfile(var
  f: text)`, is the program this refuses. A conforming implementation carries a
  bindability word with every `var` file parameter — the seventh thing here
  that travels as two words. *Architectural.*

- **`bind` of a non-file bindable variable** — `var clock: bindable integer` —
  is refused with *'bind' needs a file variable*, and §6.7.5.6's "otherwise"
  branch presupposes it is legal. What binding an integer to an external entity
  means is implementation-defined and undesigned. *A feature, not a fix.*

**A discriminated-schema is not a parameter-form, and this compiler accepts
one** (ADR-0171). §6.7.3.1 admits `type-name | schema-name | type-inquiry`, so
`procedure q(x: string)` is right and `procedure q(x: string(5))` is outside
the grammar. Three sources under `tests/extended/` write the second spelling
and would have to change. What is probably right is to refuse it under the two
conformance modes and admit it in the dialect with a clause of its own — it is
exactly the convenience ADR-0109 says belongs there, and the spelling already
passes ADR-0140's test. *A feature with its own record, written down rather
than done because it takes something away from every program that uses it.*

Five more, each stated in the record that made it:

- **String concatenation draws from an arena** — a fixed buffer in the runtime,
  released at the end of every statement that took from it (ADR-0111). One
  *statement* holding more live string values than the arena holds is the
  limit, and both ways of exhausting it are reported. *A decision.*

- **A subrange whose bounds are not constants is refused as a set's base
  type.** `set of 1..m` inside a procedure is legal under §6.2.3.8 b) and is
  refused: a bound the block evaluates cannot be checked against 0..255 before
  the program runs, so it is the `set of integer` limit reached by another
  route (ADR-0028, ADR-0133). Every other dynamic-bound shape — arrays,
  schemata, bare subranges, record fields, file components — works since
  ADR-0127, ADR-0133 and ADR-0134. *A decision.*

- **ExpDigits is not a fixed number** (ADR-0064). §6.10.3.4.1 makes it one
  implementation-defined value; here it is what C's `%E` writes — two digits,
  or three past 1e100. A conforming processor pads `E+00` to `E+000`. *A
  decision, stated as a deviation.*

- **§6.5.6's substring aliasing rule is not enforced** (ADR-0057), for
  ADR-0027's reason: a property of values at run time that nothing tracks. *A
  decision.*

- **Nothing is known and unfixed about conformance** beyond this list. Both
  standards are complete, four adversarial audits have run (ADR-0162,
  ADR-0167, ADR-0168, ADR-0171), and the last seven findings of the fourth
  were closed on 2026-08-23. A claim no test names is a claim nothing checks
  — so the next audit is worth running whenever the list above has not moved
  for a while.

## Answered, and where

Every question this file has carried and closed. The narrative of each — what
the survey found, what the estimate got wrong — is in
[`doc/history.md`](history.md#what-the-roadmap-answered); the decision is in
the record.

| Question | Answer | Record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Does the dialect spend reserved words? | No, permanently: a feature is spelled where a conforming program could not have written it, and `reserved-words` enforces it | ADR-0140 |
| Does containment survive the link? | Yes, except where the dialect would emit a check the other mode does not; the conforming `lib/` is reachable from the dialect | ADR-0137 |
| Is containment witnessed by more than one program? | The whole of `tests/extended/` under `--std=afterschool`, every run | ADR-0138 |
| Are the dialect's pieces coherent? | Four result shapes, one rule in two questions; a boundary shape may be a parameter and not a result | ADR-0141, ADR-0149 |
| Do the conformance modes "stay exactly as they are"? | What they accept does not move for the dialect; what they say may | ADR-0154 |
| Memory safety: deferral or discovery? | Lifetime was already answered, by the file variable; aliasing waits on concurrency | ADR-0151 |
| An oracle nobody here wrote | The BSI suite, fetched not committed; `src/` back as a reference front end | ADR-0086, ADR-0108 |
| Diverse double-compiling | Run once, 2026-08-18, identical outputs; `seed/ddc.sh` | `seed/README.md` |
| Conformant array parameters, and level 1 | Done, and the 51 BSI level-1 programs found nine defects in the first implementation | ADR-0153 |
| Can anything measure what the corpus reaches? | Three coverage gates and a clause-cited suite | ADR-0103 – ADR-0106 |
| Is the platform lock scoped? | Three things, two done; 32-bit is what remains | ADR-0155 – ADR-0159 |
| Can a conforming program learn that a file is missing? | `binding(f).bound` says whether it is there | ADR-0172 |
| Can a program get its arguments as a list? | `argcount` and `argument(k)`, required identifiers of the dialect | ADR-0173 |
| Can a foreign address be owned? | A handle-type: a file variable for it, released where a file closes | ADR-0174 |
| What is a character, once a byte is not one? | A grapheme cluster; text is UTF-8 in normal form C, in a value with a byte capacity, and `char` is left alone because it cannot widen | ADR-0189 |
